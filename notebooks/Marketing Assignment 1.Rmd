The RFM approach targets customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value of past purchases which are strong predictors of future purchasing behaviour of the customers. By focusing on the recent, frequent, high-value buyers the RFM approach manages to allocate marketing resources more appropriately as compared to a mass marketing strategy as observed above. The RFM approach yields higher response rates, better conversion, and higher net profit and ROI as it manages to-
1. Reduce Waste by not targeting those customers who are unlikely to respond
2. Increase efficiency by focusing on those with higher propensity to buy
3. Enhances customer experience by tailoring offers to those interested in them resulting in higher customer loyalty and lifetime value

# RFM Analysis for Tuscan Lifestyles

## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of customer behavior for Tuscan Lifestyles using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The project aims to segment customers based on their historical purchasing behavior and predict their future response rates to marketing efforts.

The analysis was performed as part of a marketing assignment where the objective was to determine the optimal marketing strategy based on RFM segmentation.

## Project Files
The repository is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the raw data used for the analysis.
  - **TuscanDataForRFMAnalysis.csv**: The dataset for the RFM analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the R code and scripts.
  - **RFM_analysis.Rmd**: The R code used to perform the RFM analysis and generate the results.
- `results/`: Contains the results of the analysis.
  - **Assignment_Solution.pdf**: The final PDF that contains the code output and results.
- **Assignment_1.pdf**: The marketing assignment prompt outlining the tasks.
- **Case_Assessing_RFM_at_Tuscan_Lifestyles.pdf**: The case study providing background information for the analysis.
- **Marketing_Assignment_1.pdf**: Another version of the marketing assignment details.

## Analysis Breakdown
### Key Tasks:
